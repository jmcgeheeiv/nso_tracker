# nso_tracker
This is a no-nonesense spreadsheet for tracking multiple stock option grants and exercises.
The spreadsheet is set up for four year vesting with a one year cliff.

Your enhancements and corrections are welcome!

## Usage
The option tracker is delivered as an Excel workbook containing several worksheets.  As an example,
it currently contains three option grants and two exercises.

Modify the workbook with your own data.
 
### Grants
Create a worksheet for each of your own grants. In the upper left, enter the *Number of option shares*,
*Exercise price per share* and *Vesting start date*. These numbers and dates appear on your
*Notice of Stock Option Grant*.
 
### Exercises
When you exercise your options, in the *Exercises* section, fill in *Date*, *Quantity* and *Share value*.
As your company' shares becomes more valuable, your company publishes an updated value per share.

If the share value on the date of exercise is higher than the Exercise price per share, you owe tax
on the *Exercise Income* shown.  Ouch!
